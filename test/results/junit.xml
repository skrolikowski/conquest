      <failure message="failed"><![CDATA[Unexpected Errors:
      [1] <engine-1>Navigation map synchronization had 14316 edge error(s).
      More than 2 edges tried to occupy the same map rasterization space.
      This causes a logical error in the navigation mesh geometry and is commonly caused by overlap or too densely placed edges.
      Consider baking with a higher 'cell_size', greater geometry margin, and less detailed bake objects to cause fewer edges.
      Consider lowering the 'navigation/2d/merge_rasterizer_cell_scale' in the project settings.
      This warning can be toggled under 'navigation/2d/warnings/navmesh_edge_merge_errors' in the project settings.
